# End to End Diabetes Classification

## **Project Overview**

![Diabetes](https://activo.co.za/wp-content/uploads/1-1-1400x788.png)

This Project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify patients into two categories:

- `No Diabetes (0)`
- `Diabetes (1)`

The Model will achieve at least **+90% accuracy and recall**, we will focus on the recall metric because False negatives (missed diagnoses, where a patient has diabetes but the model predicts they do not) are more dangerous than false positives (which can be ruled out with additional tests). This classification model will eventually be integrated into a larger healthcare application that identifies multiple diseases.

## **Project Objectives**

- Develop a robust diabetes classification model with > 90% accuracy and recall
- Address class imbalance in the dataset
- Identify the most effective modeling technique through comparative analysis
- Optimize hyperparameters using ***Optuna***
- Implement MLOps best practices with ***ZenML*** and ***MLflow***
- Create scalable, maintainable code using design patterns
  - ***Scalable code***: Code that can grow without major rewrites
  - ***Maintainable code***: Code that's easy to understand, modify, and debug (clear organization, well-documented, and following consistent standards)

## **Dataset Understanding**

The dataset includes:

### Target Variable

- **diabetes**: Binary classification (0: No diabetes, 1: Diabetes)

### Features

**Categorical Features**:

- gender: Patient's gender
- smoking_history: Patient's smoking history

**Binary Features (0/1)**:

- hypertension: Indicates if patient has hypertension
- heart_disease: Indicates if patient has heart disease

**Continuous Features**:

- age: Age of the patient
- bmi: Body Mass Index
- HbA1c_level: Hemoglobin A1c level
- blood_glucose_level: Blood glucose level
